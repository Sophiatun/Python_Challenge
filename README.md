# Python_Challenge

# Module 3 Challenge

I created a new repository for this project called python-challenge
Inside my local Git repository, I created a folder for PyBank and PyPoll

Inside of each folder I created a file called `main.py', which is the the main script to run for each analysis and A `Resources` folder that contains the CSV files used

For PyBank, I created a python script to analyze financial records to get the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

And for PyPoll, I created a python script to analyze the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

Lastly, I printed both of the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results
